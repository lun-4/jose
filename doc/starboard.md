Starboard
==================

JosÃ© has a starboard feature, with it you can star messages (using a command or
    reacting to a message with :star:) and they'll appear at the starboard channel.

 * You can only setup 1 starboard per server/guild.
 * If a message is starred and that message is from the starboard channel,
    it gets ignored.
