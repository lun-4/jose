:ok_hand: **THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TOP NOTCH READING FOR PEOPLE ADDING JOSÉ TO NEW SERVERS** :ok_hand:

In José, `josespeak` is the module responsible for Text Generation, or, more generally, speaking.

José needs source text so he can make its sentences, currently José gets 3000 messages from the server's default channel(usually #general).

In technical terms, `josespeak` has its `on_message` event, that only calculates the probability of receiving an answer from José(default is 1%), when needed, a text generator is born, `Texter`. The `Texter` is *usually* filled with 3000 messages from the server's default channel, the messages go through a filter and messages from José are ignored. Botblock rules still apply.

(removed actions: Message storage to SQL, wordlength calculation)

There are 2 extra `Texter`s after the server ones, one is the "cult" generator, which uses the file `jose-data.txt` to generate formal texts, and the "global" generator, which uses the file `zelao.txt`, this file has **ALL MESSAGES FROM EVERY SERVER** but without separation for "who said what", the messages are just dumped there. Those `Texters` are only generated in José's startup.
